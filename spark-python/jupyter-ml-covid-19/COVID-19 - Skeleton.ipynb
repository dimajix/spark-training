    "This notebook analyzes the growth of the COVID-19 pandemy. It relies on the data provided by Johns Hopkins CSSE at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 . The main question is: how will the number of infected people change over time. We will use a very simple approach, that should not be used for serious predictions of spreads of deseases, but which is well supported in PySpark. For a better mathematical model, please read https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIR-Modell . Unfortunately there is no support in PySpark for estimating model parameters within a more meaningful model. \n",

    "\n",
    "The very first step in every machine learning project is to split up the whole data into two data sets, the *training data* and the *validation data*. The basic idea is that in order to validate our model, we need some data that was not used during training. That is what the *validation data* will be used for. If we did not exclude the data from the training, we could only infer information about how good the model fits to our data - but we would have no information about how good the model copes with new data. And the second aspect is crucial in prediction applications, where the model will be used on new data points which have never been seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different approaches how to do that, but not all approaches work in every scenario. In our use case we are looking at a time series, therefore we need to split the data at a specific date - we need to hide out some information for the training phase. For time series it is important not to perform a random sampling, since this would imply information creep from the future. I.e. if we exclude day 40 and include day 50 in our training data set, day 50 obviously has some information on day 40, which normally would not be available."

Therefore other approaches involving more meaningful models like https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIR-Modell could give better prediction results. But those models require a completely different numerical approach for fitting the model to the data. We used the tool at hand (in this case PySpark) to generate a model, which does only make very mild (and possibly wrong) assumptions about the development process of the desease. Nevertheless such approaches might also give good results, since on the other hand specific mathematical models also rely on very specific assumptions and simplifications, which may also not be justified."
