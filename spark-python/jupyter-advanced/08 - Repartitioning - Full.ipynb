    "# Repartitioning DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitions are a central concept in Apache Spark. They are used for distributing and parallelizing work onto different executors, which run on multiple servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining Partitions\n",
    "Basically Spark uses two different strategies for splitting up data into multiple partitions:\n",
    "1. When Spark loads data, the records are put into partitions along natural borders. For example every HDFS block (and thereby every file) is represented by a different partition. Therefore the number of partitions of a DataFrame read from disk is solely determined by the number of HDFS blocks\n",
    "2. Certain operations like `JOIN`s and aggregations require that records with the same key are physically in the same partition. This is achieved by a shuffle phase. The number of partitions is specified by the global Spark configuration variable `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` which has a default value of 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repartitiong Data\n",
    "Since partitions have a huge influence on the execution, Spark also allows you to explicitly change the partitioning schema of a DataFrame. This makes sense only in a very limited (but still important) set of cases, which we will discuss in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weather Example\n",
    "Surprise, surprise, we will again use the weather example and see what explicit repartitioning gives us."
