I have not found anything else like this, and it is a positive, ingenious approach to losing the binky.  What I love most about this product is how much ownership my daughter has in getting rid of the binky.  She is so proud of herself, and loves her little fairy.  I love the artwork, the chart in the back, and the clever approach of this tool.\t5\nStop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book\tAll of my kids have cried non-stop when I tried to ween them off their pacifier, until I found Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet.  It is an easy way to work with your kids to allow them to understand where their pacifier is going and help them part from it.This is a must buy book, and a great gift for expecting parents!!  You will save them soo many headaches.Thanks for this book!  You all rock!!\t5\nStop Pacifier Sucking without tears with Thumbuddy To Love's Binky Fairy Puppet and Adorable Book\tWhen the Binky Fairy came to our house, we didn't have any special gift and book to help explain to her about how important it is to stop using a pacifier. This book does a great job to help prepare your child for the loss of their favorite item. The doll is adorable and we made lots of cute movies with the Binky Fairy telling our daughter about what happens when the Binky Fairy comes. I would highly recommend this product for any parent trying to break the pacifier or thumb sucking habit.\t5\nA Tale of Baby's Days with Peter Rabbit\tLovely book, it's bound tightly so you may not be able to add alot of photos/cards aside from the designated spaces in the book. Shop around before you purchase, as it is currently listed at Barnes & Noble for 29.95!\t4\nBaby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log\tPerfect for new parents. We were able to keep track of baby's feeding, sleep and diaper change schedule for the first two and a half months of her life. Made life easier when the doctor would ask questions about habits because we had it all right there!\t5\nBaby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log\tA friend of mine pinned this product on Pinterest so I decided to give it a whirl! It is fantastic! If you are a new parent, this will help you keep track of feedings, diaper changes and the like!\t5\nBaby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log\tThis has been an easy way for my nanny to record all the key events that happen with my baby when I'm not at home.  Would highly recommend it to someone who wants to stay informed of what your baby is up to while you're not home.The only reason this isn't a 5 is because I think there could have been some more standarad pre-printed options.I plan on ordering another one when we run out of pages in this journal.\t4\n"}]},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1521574892473_-1899202061","id":"20170129-041420_2034427172","dateCreated":"2018-03-20T19:41:32+0000","status":"READY","errorMessage":"","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:105"},{"text":"%md\n## Implement PunctuationCleanupTransformer\n\nWe could simply use a udf in order to remove all punctuations, but in order to build a ML Pipeline, we implement a new `PunctuationCleanupTransformer`","dateUpdated":"2018-03-20T19:52:29+0000","config":{"tableHide":false,"editorSetting":{"language":"markdown","editOnDblClick":true},"colWidth":12,"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","editorHide":true,"results":{},"enabled":true},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<div class=\"markdown-body\">\n<h2>Implement PunctuationCleanupTransformer</h2>\n<p>We could simply use a udf in order to remove all punctuations, but in order to build a ML Pipeline, we implement a new <code>PunctuationCleanupTransformer</code></p>\n</div>"}]},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1521574892473_-1899202061","id":"20180305-192927_820245775","dateCreated":"2018-03-20T19:41:32+0000","status":"READY","errorMessage":"","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:106"},{"text":"import org.apache.spark.ml.Transformer\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.param.ParamMap\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.util.Identifiable\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructField\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StringType\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.udf\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.col\n\n\nclass PunctuationCleanupTransformer(override val uid: String) extends org.apache.spark.ml.Transformer {\n    def this() = this(org.apache.spark.ml.util.Identifiable.randomUID(\"accuEval\"))\n\n    val inputCol: org.apache.spark.ml.param.Param[String] = new org.apache.spark.ml.param.Param[String](this, \"inputCol\", \"input column name\")\n    setDefault(inputCol, \"input\")\n    def getInputCol: String = $(inputCol)\n    def setInputCol(value:String): this.type = set(inputCol, value)\n\n    val outputCol: org.apache.spark.ml.param.Param[String] = new org.apache.spark.ml.param.Param[String](this, \"outputCol\", \"output column name\")\n    setDefault(outputCol, \"output\")\n    def getOutputCol: String = $(outputCol)\n    def setOutputCol(value:String): this.type = set(outputCol, value)\n    \n    override def transform(dataset:org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[_]) = {\n        val removePunctuation = org.apache.spark.sql.functions.udf { text:String => if (text != null) text.replaceAll(\"\\\\p{Punct}\", \" \") else \"\" }\n        dataset.withColumn(getOutputCol, removePunctuation(dataset(getInputCol)))\n    }\n    \n    override def transformSchema(schema:org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType) = {\n        val outputColName = $(outputCol)\n        val outCol = org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructField(outputColName, org.apache.spark.sql.types.StringType)\n        \n        if (schema.fieldNames.contains(outputColName)) {\n          throw new IllegalArgumentException(s\"Output column $outputColName already exists.\")\n        }\n        org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType(schema.fields :+ outCol)\n    }\n\n    override def copy(extra: org.apache.spark.ml.param.ParamMap): PunctuationCleanupTransformer = defaultCopy(extra)\n}\n","dateUpdated":"2018-03-20T19:41:32+0000","config":{"colWidth":12,"editorMode":"ace/mode/scala","results":{},"enabled":true,"editorSetting":{"language":"scala","editOnDblClick":false}},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"TEXT","data":"import org.apache.spark.ml.Transformer\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.param.ParamMap\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.util.Identifiable\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructField\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.StringType\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.udf\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.col\ndefined class PunctuationCleanupTransformer\nwarning: previously defined object PunctuationCleanupTransformer is not a companion to class PunctuationCleanupTransformer.\nCompanions must be defined together; you may wish to use :paste mode for this.\n"}]},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1521574892473_-1899202061","id":"20180305-192920_1656872644","dateCreated":"2018-03-20T19:41:32+0000","status":"READY","errorMessage":"","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:107"},{"text":"%md\n## Test Transformer\n\nLets create an instance of the Transformer and test it.

I'm writing a lot because I wish I had this info before I started shopping for a diaper bag.  I am a first time mom so I am probably packing different than a mom that's been around the block.  Also, we are cloth diapering, but not 100% of the time.  We use the disposable, biodegradable inserts for the cloth covers when we want to pack light - and those things take up less room than traditional disposables.  But I wanted a bag that gave me options for either type of diaper.  Here is what I found.  I hope reading this long post will help you save some time and return shipping fees while shopping!!!I already had the Ju-Ju-Be BFF and Be Prepared before I bought the Be Right Back backpack.  I bought them at a different store (one with an amazing return policy) so I left the tags on and debated the bags for a long time.  I packed them and repacked them so many times and this is what I came up with.  The BFF is too small and the Be Prepared is too big.  Both are GREAT bags.  This company really makes quality products with excellent organization!  Let me tell you, I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to quality - I will not deal with poorly made stuff breaking down on me.  Straight to the donation station or trash if something sucks.  This company does not suck...they manufacture very well made products with very good material, zippers, snaps, magnets, etc.  Go to their website to learn about the fabric treatment process and ease of care.  (My friends that bought the cheapo bags are now drooling over the Ju-Ju-Be quality.)  So I loved both bags and I really wanted to keep them.  But I couldn't get past the BFF just being a little too small (and I'd have to have a second bag with me)...and the Be Prepared is super huge and I felt like I was carrying a suitcase.BFF:  This bag is really awesome.  The organization is surprisingly smart.  The inside pockets look small but they hold tons.  You can fit a full size wipes pack in any of the four large interior pockets (but you can't fill all pockets that much at the same time).  The smaller back interior pockets with the zippers are smaller than the open pockets but still hold quite a lot of little stuff like bibs, socks, Boogie Wipes or whatever kind of little stuff you carry around.  The front interior zipper pocket is long and shallow.  I kept putting my nursing cover in that pocket...anything bigger would bulge into the front &#34;mommy pocket&#34; and make that space smaller.  The outside pockets are insulated and hold a baby bottle or water bottle...I have a Kleen Kanteen 27 or 28 oz bottle and it did fit in that pocket but it stuck out a lot because its really tall...I didn't like that (if I was keeping the BFF bag I'd have to get smaller water bottle, and I didn't like that because I drink tons of water).  If you load up all the inside pockets you don't have a whole lot of room left for the diapers and blankets etc.  The main compartment leaves much to be desired as far as space...if you're running to the coffee shop with your girlfriends and going home you'll be fine...but you cannot pack for a whole day in here.  The &#34;mommy pocket&#34; on this bag is well organized but I found it a little too small.  I needed to fit all of my personal items in there because there was no room in the main part of the bag.  I don't carry that many things for myself: a wallet, coin purse, pen, chap stick, tiny hand lotion, cell phone, eye drops and extra pair of contact lenses.  I could not fit all that in the mommy pocket even when I put my cell phone in the separate little cell phone pocket.  My take on this bag: Its wonderful if you pack really light.  I was not even trying to get cloth diapers in there and it was still tight.  If you don't need burp clothes and a blanket and an extra outfits you'd be fine...maybe a mom with one toddler that is past the bottle stage.  I'm bummed that it didn't work because I really wanted to keep it.  It really is a cute bag.BE PREPARED: This bag is the mother ship!  Its very much like the BFF but way bigger.  I was thinking of using it for our overnight or weekend bag...if i were to pack this one like the baby's suitcase, and use the Be Right Back backpack like normal when were out of town I'd have everything I needed in those two bags for a weekend.  However, for normal daily use, the Be Prepare is a mammoth and I don't want to lug it around with me while I'm trying to hold my baby...it would fit all my cloth diapers and the kitchen sink...but its over kill for me with one infant.  I might keep this wonderful big bag anyway for weekend trips because we do a lot of those and I think its cool that they match...baby luggage :)BE RIGHT BACK:  This backpack is super cool.  It is very different from the other two bags.  It's almost perfectly in the middle of the 2 other sized bags.  It has way less of the small inside pockets.  Really only 2 big pockets on inside and 2 on outside (plus mommy pocket and 2 outside bottle pockets).  I do not mind at all that it has less pockets because I keep most of my really tiny stuff in the Ju-Ju-Be accessory bags.  If you have a small bag/pouch and don't know where to put it...stick it in the mesh zipper pouch.  This bag is comfortable to wear - definitely more comfortable than the BBF backpack straps even though I loaded it with more items (I think that is because the bag is longer so it sits on your back differently).  I have a bad back from a car accident so comfort is something I really pay attention to.  This bag is easy to get in and out of.  It opens flat, like a suitcase, so no digging for stuff.  Its shaped like a traditional backpack but I don't feel like I'm back in college when wearing it because the prints get big style points.To give you an idea of the space, here is how I pack it up:  I have my breast feeding cover and 6 disposable breast pads in the front pocket with room to spare.  Mommy pocket fits all my personal items that I listed above with room to spare.  Side bottle pockets are deeper, and my tall water bottle that was too big for BFF fits great in this bag.  I have easy access burp clothes in the other bottle pocket because I am still breast feeding (large baby bottle or sippy cup would fit easily).  The pocket on the top, by the grab handle, is super useful.  Right now I am using it for all my different kinds of small wipes packs: face wipes, paci wipes, anti bac wipes, hand sanitizer gel, etc. they all fit.  You could use that spot for so many different things that you want easy access to.  The side zipper compartment for the changing pad is very smart.  Its so out of the way.  I have the pad that came with it in there now and a pack of sanitizing wipes for public bathroom changing table.  I'll need a bigger pad when baby grows but you could fit a massive pad in there...or magazines, or change of clothes, or blanket, or iPad, or anything flat and you really can't even tell that you filled it up...its very comfortable against your back while you wear the bag.  Inside the bag in the zipper mesh pocket I have a large receiving blanket, two changes of 0-3 month clothes, 2 socks and 2 bibs.  In the back mesh pocket I have a Be Mine (packed as a first aid kit) and a similar sized bag with a little mom-fresh-up kit I put together for when I have baby puke in my hair and I look like a mess...kinda a get it together and look normal kit.  (I never could have fit that kit in the BFF and now that I have it I think its important to have somethings for yourself so you don't feel yucky).  Those items never leave the bag without getting restocked.Aside from what I just listed, in the main inside compartment I can fit 2 large burp cloths, and 2 Be Quick bags (one filled with baby items, the other filled with my disposable diaper inserts for when I don't want to bring cloth diapers), a full Fuel Cell cooler, and baby's favorite lovey.  When I do want to carry my cloth diapers I ditch the fuel cell and the Be Quick with the disposables in it.  I can then fit my cloth diaper pouch (the pouch I use is big and could fit 4 full size AIO diapers, 8 cloth wipes, wipe spray, a thin changing pad, and wet bag - so it takes up a lot of space)...then I can still fit the Be Quick with the baby items, the burp cloths, the lovey, a little bag with teethers, and my Rock'n Baby sling.So, the Be Right Back fits tons!  And it works wonderfully if you just put a few things in there.  I'm sure I'll be packing differently as my baby's needs change.  But for now, with an infant, this bag has got me covered for all day in cloth diapers or all day in disposables with a big packed lunch for mom and dad.  It also still works great to pack it light for a shorter trip...I just haven't gotten to where I can pack light all the time personally.  The bag is very versatile as far as what you can take with you.  Where it is not versatile is carry style.  Its a backpack...if you don't like backpacks keep shopping.All the Ju-Ju-Be accessories are made to fit into the main bags.  I highly recommend getting the accessory bags so you can organize yourself and know that your stuff will always fit in your main bag.  Using the smaller bags to organize makes it SO very easy to switch from bag to bag without leaving anything behind on accident.  I love the organization!  There are a few things that are kinda vanishing from the companies website...I think they are revamping a few designs because they are running out of some of their most popular accessories...I expect to see them come back with a newly added pocket or zipper or something.Ju-Ju-Be is good about having lots of print selections to choose from.  I do find a lot of the prints too feminine for my taste, which is why I love the Royal Envy print...honestly, if that Be Prepared bag I have was a different print I'd just return it and buy that bag again later when I really need it...but Royal Envy is discontinued and I really don't want to part with it knowing it won't be available later.  If you are new to this company know this...once you pick out your main bag, if you want to load up on accessories that match you better not wait too long.  I can't believe how fast they sell out - then the print is discontinued and you are left to sadly troll Ebay looking for the pieces you want.  Just buy them when you get the main bag.  They are worth it, and everything from this company has great resale...there are FB groups devoted to buy, sell, trade Ju-Ju-Be stuff.(Side note: This bag is has a very sporty look.  Great for normal days running around.  I also bought a Nest, Dexter diaper bag for dressy occasions.  That bag is very different from this one and it's awesome too but I haven't reviewed it.  And that bag fits all the Ju-Ju-Be accessory bags that I love.  I mentioned my husband as a men's diaper backpack.  It's the Quicksilver Daddy Day Bag.  Great man bag!)I was going to proof read and spell check but after writing all this I'm over it!  Sorry for any typos.  Really hope this helps you.\t1.0\t[-2626.7249558996123,2626.7249558996123]\t1.0\nColgate Eco Classica I Crib mattress, Damask Cloth Cover\tOur little one hasn't arrived yet, so my review is of the product only, not our child's success on the mattress. ***UPDATED TWICE AT END***That said, this is an excellent mattress.  From what I know so far, I can't stress that enough.  We had an old Colgate foam mattress, and decided to go ahead and get a new one, going with this Eco version.The surface material is greatly improved.  It's cloth; it's soft!  I like the look and feel of it much more than the older models, but it does require a waterproof mattress pad to avoid staining, so if you don't want to have to buy a waterproof mattress pad, that might be a consideration.  The only other noticeable difference is the absence of the little coin-sized side vents that were in our old mattress.  I'm not sure why these have been omitted; I imagine they were either a choking hazard, or the new design just doesn't require them.The Eco Classica seems to be at LEAST as firm as our old Colgate, probably more firm just because the old one had been used for years.  It's the same lightweight design, and I couldn't be happier.  We looked into getting one of the expensive organic mattresses, but decided on the Eco Classica for three reasons:(1) Weight.  As much as I'm tempted by the organic mattresses, I just do not want to have to fight with a heavy mattress in the middle of the night for sheet changes.  It's simply no fun.  The Colgate foam mattresses make this an absolute breeze.(2) Reputation.  Everywhere I've looked (Baby Book of Bargains, etc) has recommended the Colgate line of mattresses; they are the oldest crib mattress manufacturer around, are firm enough to be awesome SIDS protection, and just seem generally unstoppable.  Finding a somewhat more ecological friendly version f the Colgate classic was a perfect solution for us.  We wanted to keep the safety and convenience qualities of a foam mattress, and high density foam just isn't going to be organic.(3) Mattress pad.  We have high-end waterproof organic mattress pads.  This means that the baby's sleep surface (organic sheets, organic mattress pad) is going to be organic.  I'm not sure if there are any benefits to the baby from an organic mattress itself, if you're just putting something waterproof (and thus rather impermeable) over the mattress.  Seems either irrelevant or overkill to make sure the mattress itself is organic if the mattress pad is, and nothing can get through the mattress pad...***UPDATE 9/2010*** We've used this mattress now for two months and our son loves it.  It has held up well and he seems quite comfortable despite the firmness.  In fact, we moved him out of his bassinet and into the crib earlier than we'd planned because he was much more comfortable on this crib mattress than in his bassinet.  The light weight is a HUGE PLUS, as we sleepily change sheets after midnight diaper leaks.  Lastly, the mattress is super snug in our crib -- a perfect fit.  As with any first-time parent, there are certainly baby items we've purchased that we regret, or don't need, or will never ever use, but this mattress stands out as one of those few really perfect finds.***UPDATE 11/2011*** We've been using this mattress for about 15 months now, and if I could give it SIX stars, I would. The firmness has never seemed to be a problem for our little guy, who has never seemed uncomfortable on this surface. As a toddler now, he still sleeps for 10-12 hours without interruption on this mattress - no pillow - and seems just fine.  Additionally, he spends tons of time rambunctiously playing in his crib at naptime, before he falls asleep, and when he first wakes in the morning, and the mattress shows NO signs of wear or tear. Despite lots of dancing, jumping, and standing in the same place day after day on this mattress, it is as firm and crisp as the day it arrived.***UPDATE 07/2012*** We've now been using the mattress for two years, and still don't have a single complaint.  This mattress is tough; the firmness has never deteriorated.  Our baby is now a toddler, and this mattress has moved from being a crib mattress to a toddler bed mattress.  The little one still sleeps like a charm, still with no pillow, and never a sign of discomfort.  As noted above, despite months of toddler play, the mattress is as firm and crisp as the day it arrived!\t1.0\t[-1685.6178385749806,1685.6178385749806]\t1.0\nBaby Jogger City Lite Stroller, Black\tAMAZING stroller!  It took me about 2 minutes to put together once out of the box.Very smooth ride.  My little one LOOOOVED riding in this stroller.  Not having a tray in front actually makes it much easier to get them in and out without getting stuck, but they are very securely fastened inside.  And the canopy, I can't rave about it enough.  It is definitely extra large, but it doesn't obstruct your view or your child's.  The canopy is very roomy at the top and not claustrophobic feeling even though it curves down, in fact one of my favorite features is how it curves down towards your little one just a bit.  I've found that I no longer have to have a sunhat, or baby sunglasses (neither of which stayed on for long) to shield the sun from eyes.  In other strollers my little one is often squinting (because she won't keep the hats or glasses on), but with this stroller she is shaded perfectly to the point that those things are necessary any more.  Doesn't seem to matter what angle the sun is in.  Another benefit is that I don't have to put sunscreen on her face as it's completely shaded.One of the things that they don't really mention in their product description is that it's surprisingly compact when closed.  Unlike my previous stroller which took up the entire back of my SUV because it would only fit horizontally in the space, this one fits vertically in the back so that I have half of my &#34;trunk&#34; space for other things.  I can take this stroller just about anywhere because I know I will have storage room to spare even with it in the back.  I no longer have had those moments when shopping, opening the back only to realize that I forgot to take the stroller out of the back before leaving the house.  That is so frustrating!  I don't have to worry about that anymore :)  If you have a minivan, then you can probably stand it up on end and have even more &#34;trunk&#34; space.Even with all of the other things I love about this stroller, the thing I love the most is how easily you can open, close and carry this stroller one handed.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the one hand open and close feature.  This works like a dream and is so lightweight you can easily handle this with one arm (especially nice if you are disabled or only have one arm)If you are tall, then this stroller will be a godsend as the handle seems to come up higher than others.  An older Chicco stroller we had did have an adjustable handle that you could tilt to a higher position but this handle is even better.  My sister is tall (5'10&#34;-5'11&#34;)  I'm around 5'5&#34;-5'6&#34; and it fits us both very comfortably without any adjustment.One thing that is kind of misleading from the name of the stroller is that it is a &#34;Baby Jogger City Lite&#34;, but is not intended for running.  The name of the brand is &#34;Baby Jogger&#34; and the model is &#34;City Lite&#34;.  I didn't get it for the jogging capability, but for the one handed closing /opening feature, and that it was lightweight, yet could carry up to 55 lb child, and had LOTS of storage. Not being a jogging stroller that wasn't a big deal for me, but it is something that you will want to note especially considering the style and maker.I know there are other strollers out there that cost more, that are supposed to be better, but I just can't imagine how that could be, nor that it would be necessary to pay more.  This stroller is perfect for me.  I would buy this stroller again and again and HIGHLY recommend it.  I've had three previous strollers in the past 5 years, and this one is by far the best one I've had.  BY FAR.  I wish I would have had this one to begin with because I would have saved myself so much money it's not even funny.  It has everything that I want in a stroller (once I bought a couple of the accessories) so I firmly believe this will be the last one I ever get.  I liked it so much that I gave one to my sister who needs a stroller that she can manipulate one handed, and she loves it just as much as I do.\t1.0\t[-1607.896991291005,1607.896991291005]\t1.0\nPhil &amp; Teds Navigator Buggy Golden Kiwi Free 2nd Seat NAVPR12200\tI'm pretty happy with this stroller. I use it with my 3 year old boy and 5 month old twins. At the moment, my twins go in the main seats and my boy sits on the footplate. Not exactly what the designers had in mind, and not the best for weight distribution, but my son loves his 'freeride' seat.I had been looking at this stroller online and was calling stores to find out if they stocked it, but no one did. So when I saw the double kit on sale, I decided to take a chance and hope for the best. And I think I couldn't really do better.Prior to purchasing this stroller I tried out the Britax B Ready, Baby Jogger City Select, Baby Jogger City Mini Double and BOB double stroller. I really wanted a tandem stroller but wasn't too impressed with the quality of the Britax and found the City Select hard to push with just my 3 year old in it. The side by side strollers I tested were so easy to maneuver but I was really loathe to have a stroller so wide.Lots of reviews I have read about double strollers say that they haven't found their perfect one yet but they don't think it exists, and I'll concur. This stroller is pretty good, but it's not perfect.The pros:* Very smooth ride, even fully loaded. The sidewalks in my neighborhood are dire and so this is really important for me. Maneuvers well over grass, playground mulch and bumpy terrain.* Glides easily through doorways and tight spaces so you can feel a little smug when your zipping in and out of your local coffee shop without requesting help and/or running over the patrons.* Love the big canopy with huge side pockets.* The mustard yellow color is really chic and so different from other strollers out there.* Easy to open and collapse. Although not quite a one handed job.* The picture shows the standard double seating set up, but there is a second set up which turns the main seat into a bassinet type thing and the second seat goes on the top. When my twins were small I could fit both of them in the main seat at the same time.* Nice adjustable handle.* Good quality materials and sturdy frame. Not a plastic/squeaky frame like the Britax.* It doesn't look like much space, and in actual fact it's not much, but my 3 year old (50th percentile) can fit into the bottom second seat, although I wouldn't want to stick him there for an hour long walk. So I feel pretty confident that this stroller will last us a good couple of years.* Most people don't notice that there are two kids in the stroller, which I like since twins tend to get a lot of attention which makes me a little nervous because I'm worried about germs (they were preemies).The cons:* The huge basket completely disappears once the second seat is in, so there's no place to stow a diaper bag or toys once the second kid is in. This is the major con with this type of stroller and where the side by side stroller has an advantage.* The second seat doesn't fully recline but reclines enough for a baby with good head control.* The weight allowance is not equal for both seats so it's probably not the best option for twins, but I'm hoping that won't be too much of a problem since I have one fat twin and one not so fat twin.* The shade on the second seat isn't that great and I wish it was yellow like the main canopy.* The instructions really suck! There are lots of zips and straps and buckles which means there are a number of small adjustments you can make to this stroller but you just have to figure it out by yourself.* Setting up the main seat for a newborn is a pain in the butt so you really only want to do it once and not have to collapse the stroller until the baby grows out of that phase.* It's not exactly light at 25lbs, but then again, it could be much worse.* You can't use it with many infant car seats, although that wasn't really a problem for me since I just use it for walks around my neighborhood.* It doesn't stand on its own when collapsed.* You have to take the second seat off when collapsing it (although it's pretty easy to take off).* The bumper bar isn't easy to put on and take off.* It's pretty stable but not stable enough for your 3 year old to crawl into the bottom seat without someone holding the stroller. My 3 year old and I learned this the hard way!* The foot brake is not in the best position. When the second seat is on, it completely covers the bright red brake so you kind of have to feel around with your foot.If you're looking for a high quality tandem stroller with great maneuverability, a couple of seating options and don't mind carrying your diaper bag then definitely get this stroller. I'm really happy with it. However, if you are the type of person who needs a large basket, cup holder, snack tray and lots of seating options, then this is definitely not the stroller for you.\t1.0\t[-1317.027176365585,1317.027176365585]\t1.0\nLansinoh mOmma Bottle with NaturalWave Nipple, 8 Ounce\tAs parents of two little ones, I'd like to say we are experts in appreciating different baby bottle designs and what works best for baby.  Here's our criteria for a baby bottle and why the purple/redesigned Lansinoh mOmma natural wave bottle is 5 stars for us.Our Baby Bottle Criteria:====================First and foremost,BABY MUST LIKE IT!---------------------------------Munchkin Latch Bottle:Fails here because the nipple easily collapses.  Just a very slight pressure with your finger and the nipple collapses.  Now, imagine a moving baby with a slurping motion and this nipple collapses too easily.Avent Classic Bottle:We have a dozen of these from our firstborn.  Unfortunately, our son just won't take these.  We tried all of the nipple sizes from NB to level 3, he just won't take it.  We had learned long ago to just get 1 bottle of each type, because different babies like different bottles, no rhyme or reason.  Our daughter loved these.Avent Natural Flow bottle/nipple:He will actually finish a full bottle with this, but the bib and burp cloth will be drenched.  The wider/flat design means he just drools and drools.  Maybe good for others, but not for him.Dr. Brown:He was colic-y at first and this is the only bottle he would take without drooling.  He loves them, we the parents despise them because of the cleaning - 6 parts to clean.  But baby first and we endured this for 6-7 months until we discovered the Lansinoh mOmma *Natural Wave* bottles.Lansinoh mOmma *Natural Wave* bottle:I put asterisks around Natural Wave because Lansinoh has an older &#34;Lansinoh mOmma&#34; that is round in shape (and has orange coloring).  The Lansinoh mOmma natural wave bottles look like regular bottles and are purple in coloring.  So make sure you are reading about the right mOmma type!This is the only bottle in addition to the Dr. Brown that he would take.  No drooling (we don't even need a bib or burp cloth), he finishes everything and most of all, it is so easy to clean!  (just 4 parts more on that later)After baby approves, the next criteria is:HOW EASY IS IT TO CLEAN?==========================Munchkin Latch Bottle:This is pretty terrible, probably 1-star for cleaning along with Dr. Brown.  The nipple is an accordion design on the bottom that is supposed to allow for easy movement (and probably why it collapses so easy under suction).  Well, can you imagine trying to clean in between the grooves of an accordion?  What a pain.  Then, it has this blue-vent piece at the bottom of the bottle that you have to pop out and has small crevices that you can't really fit any bottle brush into, not even the Munchkin baby bottle brush set - hah!  Furthermore, having this &#34;hole&#34; at the bottom is terrible if you soak your bottles with water because you always have to have the blue-vent piece in there.Avent Classic:Probably a 2 for cleaning because it has 5 parts.  It has this blue ring that is annoying to clean.  We put up with it for 2 years until we switch our daughter to cow milk.Avent Natural Flow:Probably a 4 for cleaning because it has 4 parts.  The middle nipple-holder piece is designed just-so that it really tears up the sponges in your bottle brush.Dr. Brown:All parents despise cleaning them, yet baby-first and this is the bottle we used for 6-7 months until we discovered the new Lansinoh mOmma redesign.  If I could give negative stars for cleaning a Dr. Brown bottle I would.  All of the small intricate parts are a pain to clean, ask anyone, bleh.Lansinoh mOmma *Natural Wave* purple bottle:We love it, 5-stars for cleaning.  4 simple parts that is compatible with our bottle brush, nice wide design, easy to assemble, super easy to clean.OVERALL DESIGN THOUGHTS:===========================Munchkin Latch Bottle:Terrible.  The lid completely covers the middle-nipple-holder part.  This means after you have warmed up the bottle with hot water, you spin and spin the lid because there's no other surface to grab and it's slippery because it is wet.  If you have soapy hands and are trying to unscrew the top, it will spin and spin, too. All of the other bottles, the lid rests-on or at least is designed such that you can easily grip and separate the cap/lid.  Terrible to transport, must use a sealing disc, else it leaks.Avent Classic:Has a flat top.  Easy to put down the cap/lid and won't roll away while adding formula, etc.  Easy to grip, just don't like the extra &#34;ring&#34; that must be cleaned.  Used this for 2 years with our first one.  Smallest size is 4 ounces or 125 ML - this was too little and the 9 ounce was a big leap.  5 ounces would have been perfect for a long time. Easy to transport, no spills, nothing extra required.Avent Natural Flow:Same slippery lid issue as the Munchkin, but not as bad.  Rolls around the counter if you take the cap/lid off.  Smallest size is also 4 ounces/125 ml.  Easy to transport, no spills, nothing extra required.Dr. Brown:The bottle we the parents despised cleaning the most, but we used it for 6-7 months because it DID help with a colic-y baby.  Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  Smallest size is 4 ounces /120 ml, but you CANNOT overfill, it will leak. We despise the 9-ounce version of Dr. Brown - too big for our bottle brush and bleh it actually makes cleaning worse if that was possible.  Another terrible design is that you have to take the cap off to install a sealing-disc if you transport this!  The last thing you want to do in a public place is have to take the cap off, etc exposing the milk to the elements.  If you put this in an insulated cooler and the bottle is not kept vertical and tips over, you'll have milk everywhere.Lansinoh mOmma Natural Wave (the purple one, not the orange one):The lid is great, it has a completely flat side that is easy to put down and won't roll around.  Our baby can drink an entire bottle with no bib or burp cloth.  The smallest size is 5 ounces which is perfect for our baby's needs. Easy to transport, no spills, nothing extra required.Basically, all the benefits of the Dr. Brown, but easy to clean.  Baby likes it and we don&#8217;t even use a bib or burp cloth when using this bottle!\t1.0\t[-1308.6901221462322,1308.6901221462322]\t1.0\nMaxi Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat, Sweet Cerise\tUPDATE: After a year of use, we still love this seat! My daughter is a tall 2 year old, and still fits very comfortably in it rear facing. She is completely content and comfortable, and loves her seat.Original Post: After MUCH deliberation (and 10+hrs of research), I decided to go with this car seat over a Britax for my 12 month old. The main selling point for me was the comfort. Overall, I am pleased with my decision. Here's why:Pro's:SUPER comfortable for my baby. I wish I had one of these to ride in! It is so cushy, and she sleeps great in it. It also reclines enough to be comfortable for her to sleep in (which I know is a big problem with other seats).Even in the rear-facing, most reclined position it takes up LESS room front to back than our Graco snug-ride infant car seat did. I was amazed, because it looks so bulky, but we were actually able to push the front passenger seat back a little! With a small car, this is a huge plus.It has awesome safety ratings, is tested rigorously, is very sturdy, and I feel reassured that she is very safe in her seat.Because of the way it is designed, she can ride rear facing for a long time, which is SO much safer for little ones. She is very tall, but I will still keep her rear facing past age 2.The cup holder! Although it is a minor detail, it makes a HUGE difference. On a Britax you have to buy the cup holder separately, and it has very mixed reviews.Other features, such as a storage pouch in the seat for the instruction manual, and a storage place for every belt and anchor when it is not in use, are big bonuses. This seat was very well thought out and effectively designed.Con's:Since it is a fairly new product, the instruction manual has lots of typos and errors. It is a pretty user friendly, easy to follow manual, but it has some big mistakes in it and confusing parts that actually caused us MAJOR headache. The seat sat in our living room for 3 days because we couldn't figure out how to get the LATCH belt out of the forward facing position and into the rear facing position. After my husband and I both spending hours trying to figure it out, spending over an hour on the phone with a representative who had NO idea what she was talking about (and was actually giving me incorrect instructions), writing a frustrated email, and sending them pictures of the problem, we finally got it resolved. It ended up being a very simple fix, and in the end we had a very kind, helpful costumer service rep go above and beyond to make sure we had it fixed. So, despite the frustrations, I ended up being VERY happy with the company and their service. I have now moved the belt back and forth multiple times, and it is very simple.It is a little tricky to install. There were a few minutes when I thought I would have to return the seat because I couldn't get it tight enough. However, after making sure it was at the proper recline position, and tightening the LATCH belt as much as I could, I am happy with the results. It just takes a little practice to get it right.It is really bulky side to side, and quite tall. This can be a good thing because my daughter sits so high she can see out the window, but it makes it difficult to get her in the car, into the seat, and buckled up. There is hardly any room between the sides of the seat, the door, and the ceiling. We have to kind of twist her and squeeze her in, and half the time my husband bonks her head on the door because it is so tight. It is also hard to get used to buckling quickly when you can't fit both of your arms in very well. At first it was very difficult and frustrating, but once you get used to it it's not too bad. It really did take us about a month to get used to putting her in the seat and buckled up, but now that we've had practice we are much faster at it.Biggest CON: Since the seat cover is so thick and cushy, it is very hard to clean. The instructions say to hand wash it and line dry, but I have to admit I don't think I will ever do that again. My daughter threw up all over it (so spot cleaning wasn't an option), and I spent over an hour trying to wash it. My hands ached afterwards from all the ringing since the material is so absorbent. It took over a day to completely dry. I have since (after another throw up incident) put the cover in my machine on a delicate cycle, then line dried, and I had excellent results. I know it isn't recommended, but I'm just going to cross my fingers that it is ok.Overall, the pro's outweigh the con's in our book, and we have ended up being very happy with the seat! Good luck in your search, hope this helps!\t1.0\t[-1297.079067246245,1297.079067246245]\t1.0\n"}]},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1521574892477_-1900741056","id":"20170129-044725_1084497064","dateCreated":"2018-03-20T19:41:32+0000","status":"READY","errorMessage":"","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:124"},{"text":"%md\n# Model Evaluation\n\nAs in the original exercise, we want to use a custom metric for assessing the performance.","user":"anonymous","dateUpdated":"2018-03-20T20:08:35+0000","config":{"editorSetting":{"language":"markdown","editOnDblClick":true},"colWidth":12,"editorMode":"ace/mode/markdown","editorHide":true,"results":[{"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}}],"enabled":true,"tableHide":false},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"HTML","data":"<div class=\"markdown-body\">\n<h1>Model Evaluation</h1>\n<p>As in the original exercise, we want to use a custom metric for assessing the performance.</p>\n</div>"}]},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1521574892478_-1899586810","id":"20170129-044740_1008352335","dateCreated":"2018-03-20T19:41:32+0000","dateStarted":"2018-03-20T20:08:35+0000","dateFinished":"2018-03-20T20:08:35+0000","status":"FINISHED","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:125"},{"text":"import org.apache.spark.sql.functions.col\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.util.Identifiable\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.param.Param\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.param.ParamMap\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.evaluation.Evaluator\n\nclass AccuracyClassificationEvaluator(override val uid: String) extends org.apache.spark.ml.evaluation.Evaluator {\n    \n    def this() = this(org.apache.spark.ml.util.Identifiable.randomUID(\"accuEval\"))\n\n    val labelCol: org.apache.spark.ml.param.Param[String] = new org.apache.spark.ml.param.Param[String](this, \"labelCol\", \"label column name\")\n    setDefault(labelCol, \"label\")\n    def getLabelCol: String = $(labelCol)\n    def setLabelCol(value:String): this.type = set(labelCol, value)\n\n    val predictionCol: org.apache.spark.ml.param.Param[String] = new org.apache.spark.ml.param.Param[String](this, \"predictionCol\", \"prediction column name\")\n    setDefault(predictionCol, \"prediction\")\n    def getPredictionCol: String = $(predictionCol)\n    def setPredictionCol(value:String): this.type = set(predictionCol, value)\n\n    override def evaluate(dataset: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[_]) : Double = {\n        val num_total = dataset.count()\n        val num_correct = dataset.filter(dataset(getLabelCol) === dataset(getPredictionCol)).count()\n        num_correct.toDouble / num_total\n    }\n\n    override def copy(extra: org.apache.spark.ml.param.ParamMap): AccuracyClassificationEvaluator = null // defaultCopy(extra)\n\n}","dateUpdated":"2018-03-20T20:08:49+0000","config":{"colWidth":12,"editorMode":"ace/mode/scala","results":[{"graph":{"mode":"table","height":300,"optionOpen":false,"keys":[],"values":[],"groups":[],"scatter":{}}}],"enabled":true,"editorSetting":{"language":"scala","editOnDblClick":false}},"settings":{"params":{},"forms":{}},"results":{"code":"SUCCESS","msg":[{"type":"TEXT","data":"import org.apache.spark.ml.evaluation.BinaryClassificationEvaluator\nevaluator: org.apache.spark.ml.evaluation.BinaryClassificationEvaluator = binEval_a6a343e3ff81\n0.8538896562709775\n"}]},"apps":[],"jobName":"paragraph_1521574892478_-1899586810","id":"20170129-044751_2122449463","dateCreated":"2018-03-20T19:41:32+0000","status":"READY","errorMessage":"","progressUpdateIntervalMs":500,"$$hashKey":"object:126"},{"text":"%md\n## Assess Performance\n\nWith the evaluator we can assess the performance of the prediction and easily compare it to a simple model which always predicts 'positive'.\n\nFor evaluating a model, the following steps have to be performed\n1.
